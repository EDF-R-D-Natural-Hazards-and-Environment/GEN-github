# Git/Github best practices for our team
## Introduction
This document provides a best practice guide for using Git and GitHub for version control of code within our team.


## Definitions
Git has a bunch of terminology that is specific to version control workflows. Here are some of the most common terminology.

### General
Word | Definition
--- | ---
Version control | The practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 
Git | The most popular version control software. Using a specialised command line, users can track changes made to code and other text files in a way that minimises space requirements and makes the used of cumbersome file version names redundant.
GitHub | A popular provider of internet hosting for software development and version control using Git.

### Git-specific
Word | Definition
--- | ---
Repository | A Git repository (or repo) is a directory that stores all the files, folders, and content needed for your project, including the versions and commits of those files. Repositories can be shared and copied (see: fork).
Clone | A copy of a repository ("a clone", noun) or the action of copying a repository ("to clone", verb). When cloning a repository into another branch, the new branch becomes a remote-tracking branch that can talk upstream to its origin branch (via pushes, pulls, and fetches).
Branch | A version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. Branches can be a new version of a repository, experimental changes, or personal forks of a repository for users to alter and test changes.
