# Getting started

If you have any trouble with any of these steps, email me (<matthew.allcock@edfenergy.com>) or message me on Teams.
## Install Git
Git is a version control software that you need to install on your computer to make full use of it. You can do this in one of two ways:
1. Submit a MyIT request to install Git from [this website](https://edfenergy.service-now.com/myit/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0f9cb12b1bdb7f00f875a64c2e4bcb4c).
2. Install Git directly from [this website](https://gitforwindows.org/). (I did this option and it installed correctly without the need for admin privaleges).

The default installation options should be suitable for our needs.

## Sign up for GitHub
GitHub is an online platform for version control, collaboration, and sharing of code. It is driven by Git software. Sign up for an account [here](https://github.com/). Ideally, sign up with yourwork email address.
