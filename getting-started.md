# Getting started
*Written by Matt Allcock 09/06/21*

If you have any trouble with any of these steps, email me (<matthew.allcock@edfenergy.com>) or message me on Teams.

## Sign up for GitHub
GitHub is an online platform for version control, collaboration, and sharing of code. It is driven by Git software. Sign up for an account [here](https://github.com/). Ideally, sign up with yourwork email address.

## Join the NH&E team's GitHub organisation
The NH&E team has it's own GitHub organisational page [here](https://github.com/EDF-R-D-Natural-Hazards-and-Environment). Once you have signed up for an account with GitHub, please send me an email and a message and I will invite you to the organisation. In your email/message, please let me knoe what email address you used to sign up with.

## Install Git
Git is a version control software that you need to install on your computer to make full use of it. You can do this in one of two ways:
1. Submit a MyIT request to install Git from [this website](https://edfenergy.service-now.com/myit/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0f9cb12b1bdb7f00f875a64c2e4bcb4c).
2. Install Git directly from [this website](https://gitforwindows.org/). (I did this option and it installed correctly without the need for admin privaleges).

The default installation options should be suitable for our needs.

## First commands
Once you have installed Git, open the program "Git Bash" (you can find this by using the search bar in the bottom left of the desktop). When you open it, it will open a terminal that will look something like this:

To complete your initial set-up, run the following commands so that Git can be connected to your account
